	<li> Amazon : </li>
	<li>
		As an Operations Associate at Amazon, your primary responsibility is to ensure the smooth and timely delivery of customer orders by effectively coordinating with vendors, monitoring truck movements, and implementing LTR (Late Truck Report) coding solutions in case of breakdowns or disruptions in truck operations. Utilization of the FMC GPS systems installed in each truck to track and maintain accurate routes, proactively preventing off-track situations, and promptly communicating any halts or issues to the warehouse. My role will require strong communication skills as I engaged with vendors, Vendor Managers, Warehouse In-Charge, Warehouse Managers, and, when necessary, drivers to optimize operational efficiency. My dedication to enhancing communication and LTR coding skills will play a vital role in ensuring a seamless delivery process for Amazon's customers.

</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>
	During my tenure in Btech I have done many projects some of them are:
</p>

	
<ul>
	Projects:
<hr>
<li><b>
	IoT based Health Monitoring System </b>
	<p>
		The system utilizes wearable sensors such as heart rate monitors, temperature sensors, blood pressure sensors, and 
accelerometers to collect continuous data on an individual's health. These sensors are wirelessly connected to a central 
hub or gateway, which acts as the communication interface between the sensors and the cloud-based platform. The 
collected data is transmitted securely over the internet to a cloud-based platform for storage and analysis. These 
insights can be accessed by healthcare professionals and the individual themselves through a user-friendly web or 
mobile interface. the IoT-based Health Monitoring System project leverages IoT technologies to create a scalable 
and efficient solution for remote health monitoring. By integrating wearable sensors, wireless communication, and cloud-based analytics, this project enhances the accessibility and effectiveness of healthcare, ultimately leading to improved patient outcomes and quality of life.
	</p>
</li>
<li><b>
	Face Recognition using MATLAB 2021b 
</b>
<p>
	The Face Recognition project aims to develop a robust and accurate system for automatically identifying and verifying individuals based on their facial features using MATLAB 2021b. The project involves implementing various algorithms and techniques to detect, extract, and match facial characteristics. MATLAB 2021b serves as the primary software platform for developing the face recognition system. MATLAB offers a comprehensive set of images processing and computer vision functions that facilitate the processing and analysis of facial images. It provides tools for image preprocessing, feature extraction, pattern recognition, and machine learning.
</p>
<li><b>
	Temperature &Humidity Sensing Using Arduino 
</b>
<p>
	The project involves utilizing an Arduino microcontroller and a DHT11 sensor to measure and display real-time temperature and humidity data. The project aims to create a cost-effective and reliable solution for monitoring  environmental conditions. The DHT11 sensor is a low-cost digital sensor that accurately measures temperature, humidity and heat index. It features a built-in capacitive humidity sensor and a thermistor for temperature sensing. The sensor is connected to the Arduino microcontroller using digital communication protocols.
</p>
</li>
	<li><b>
		Showing Time on LCD using PIC18F 4520 Microcontroller 	</b>
	<p>
		The project aims to create a digital clock that displays the current time on an LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) using the PIC18F4520 microcontroller. The project involves designing the hardware connections and writing the necessary firmware code to interface with the microcontroller and LCD module. The PIC18F4520 microcontroller serves as the core of the project, responsible for timekeeping, processing, and controlling the LCD display. It features built in peripherals, such as timers and interrupts, which are utilized to accurately measure time and update the display.
	</p>	
	</li>
<li><b>
	Connect Four Game Using Java </b>
	<p>
		The Connect 4 Game project aims to develop a digital implementation of the popular board game, connect 4, using the Java programming language. The project involves designing and coding a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to play the game against a computer opponent or another player.	
	</p>
</li>
<li><b>
	Clap Switch using Timer 555 & Transistors 
</b>
<p>
	This project aims to design a simple and intuitive device that can control an electrical appliance or light using sound, specifically clapping. The project utilizes the popular integrated circuit (IC) timer 555 and transistors to detect clapping sounds and trigger the switching mechanism. their arrangement, the circuit achieves the desired filtering characteristics
